🧪 LEVEL 1 — Basic Retrieval (RAG sanity test)

Use these first:

“Summarize this document in 5 bullet points.”

“What is the main objective of the Basel framework?”

“What problem was Basel designed to address?”

“Define capital adequacy according to the document.”

“What are the key components discussed in this document?”

👉 These confirm chunk retrieval is working.

🧪 LEVEL 2 — Concept Understanding

“Explain the three pillars of Basel in simple terms.”

“What is Tier 1 capital?”

“What is Tier 2 capital?”

“What is risk-weighted asset (RWA)?”

“How is capital adequacy ratio calculated?”

👉 These test whether embeddings retrieve the correct definitions.

🧪 LEVEL 3 — Analytical / Deep Questions

“Why is Basel III considered stricter than Basel II?”

“How does Basel improve financial stability?”

“What weaknesses in Basel II led to Basel III?”

“What role does liquidity coverage ratio play?”

“How does Basel regulate credit risk?”

👉 These test reasoning over multiple chunks.

🧪 LEVEL 4 — Cross-Section Reasoning

“Compare Basel I and Basel III.”

“What are the differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital?”

“How do capital buffers improve resilience?”

“Explain the supervisory review process.”

“How does market discipline function under Basel?”

👉 These test multi-chunk retrieval + synthesis.

🧪 LEVEL 5 — Memory Test (Very Important)

Ask in sequence:

Step 1

Explain the three pillars of Basel.

Step 2

Which pillar did you describe as focusing on supervisory review?

Step 3

Expand more on that pillar.

If it remembers previous answers →
🧠 Memory = Working correctly.

🧪 LEVEL 6 — Advanced Classroom Demo Prompts

“If a bank has ₹1000 crore in risk-weighted assets and ₹120 crore Tier 1 capital, what is its capital adequacy ratio?”

“Would this bank meet Basel III requirements?”

“What happens if a bank falls below minimum capital requirements?”

“Explain Basel III to a non-finance student.”

“Explain Basel regulations as if I am a CEO.”

🧪 LEVEL 7 — Stress Test Prompts (for RAG robustness)

“Quote the section that discusses liquidity risk.”

“Which page discusses capital buffers?”

“List all types of risks mentioned in the document.”

“Does the document mention leverage ratio? Explain.”

“Provide a structured outline of the document.”
